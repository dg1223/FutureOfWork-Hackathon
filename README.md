# Future of work (Hackathon)
Hackathon based on exploring the future of work as automation gets infused into our society

# Project: Futurecareers.ca
dataset.csv: A sample input file with job details and automation probability of each job

future.sh: A prototype written in shell to show how the product interacts with the user to search the TOP 5 jobs that are less susceptible to automation in the next 10 years

# Description
1.  The program asks users 10 questions. Half of these are questions about their professional preferences and the other half are about their personal preferences, more like attitudes towards work, work-life balance etc.
2.  The users rank the strength of their preferences on a scale of 10.
3.  The program uses these 10 inputs and mines the dataset to find TOP 5 jobs (idea from softmax classification) that are best suited for them and also are less susceptible to automation in the next 10 years.
